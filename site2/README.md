# The Vapourium

Not a real e-commerce store.
A very simple example site for use when demonstrating features in Netlify.

## Dependencies

This site is so simple that it has no dependencies to install. It has a little build script which copies assets around.

## Running the build

```bash
# populate the dist folder
npm run build
```
